# Innovation Prediction System

This project implements a system for predicting technological innovation trends.
It collects data from various sources (patents, funding, research papers),
engineers features, trains predictive models, and generates forecasts.

## Project Structure

- \`config/\`: Configuration files for different modules.
- \`data_collection/\`: Modules for collecting data from sources like USPTO, Crunchbase, arXiv, PubMed.
- \`feature_engineering/\`: Modules for creating predictive features from raw data.
- \`main/\`: Main execution script (\`run.py\`).
- \`model_development/\`: Modules for training and validating predictive models.
- \`monitoring/\`: Modules for system monitoring, data drift detection, and model performance evaluation.
- \`prediction/\`: Modules for generating forecasts and identifying emerging technologies.
- \`tests/\`: Unit and integration tests (to be added).
- \`uncertainty_handling/\`: Modules for managing and communicating prediction uncertainty.
- \`utils/\`: Utility functions (if any).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd innovation_prediction_system
    \`\`\`

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    \`\`\`bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use \`venv\Scripts\activate\`
    \`\`\`

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \`\`\`

4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    - Update API keys in relevant configuration files or via environment variables as needed.
      For example, Crunchbase API key in \`FundingDataCollector\` and potentially a PubMed API key in \`ResearchDataCollector\`.
      These are currently placeholder values in the code (e.g., "YOUR_CRUNCHBASE_KEY").

## Running the System

To run the main conceptual demonstration script:

\`\`\`bash
python main/run.py
\`\`\`

**Note:** The \`main/run.py\` script currently uses placeholder data and mock API calls for demonstration purposes.
Full functionality requires valid API keys and potentially more extensive historical data for model training.
The script also has temporary includes of classes and configurations which will be replaced by proper imports once the refactoring is complete.
