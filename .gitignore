# Secrets or sensitive config - ensure these are not committed
# Example:
.env
# config/secrets.yml
# *.key
# Add specific secret files here if any are used and not managed by other means.
# For this project, API keys are mentioned as placeholders in code or to be set via env vars.
# If a file like `local_settings.py` or `.env` were used for keys, it would be listed here.
# For now, ensure `innovation_system/config/settings.py` itself is NOT ignored if it contains non-sensitive defaults.
# If it were to hold live keys, it should be ignored or managed via a template system.
# Placeholder for ignoring specific local config if it were used:
# local_config.py
# local_settings.py
# For clarity, I'll ensure only one active .env line.
